### WG Membership Process

* New members are nominated by existing WG members
* Members are added/removed via Voting Consensus
  * Voting Consensus is all current WG members minus 1
  * Several members belong to the same organization. Unless/until we have a voting process thatâ€™s more complex than unanimous minus one, we use member voting and not organization voting.
* Active members are recorded on datprotocol/working-group (this document)
* Membership process is recorded on datprotocol/working-group (this document)
